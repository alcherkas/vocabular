# Retrospectives

Every agent appends a brief retrospective note at the **end of each iteration** (not every commit — see below).

## What counts as an "iteration"?

| Agent type | One iteration = |
|-----------|----------------|
| Vocab pipeline (Seeder, Enricher, etc.) | End of a session (may span multiple batches) |
| Feature Agent | After completing a task (before or after merging) |
| Product Dev Agent (Req/Arch/Verify) | After completing their role's output |
| Reflection Agent | After completing a reflection cycle |

## Entry Format

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] [agent-id] [task-id]

### What went well
- (what part of the process helped you succeed)

### What was harder than expected
- (unexpected complexity, missing context, etc.)

### Process friction
- (where agent docs were unclear, scripts failed, guardrails were wrong/too tight/too loose, conventions didn't cover a case)

### Suggested improvement
- (one specific, actionable change to docs/scripts/protocols — optional but encouraged)
```

## Rules

- **Append-only** — do not edit or delete existing entries.
- Keep each section to 1–3 bullet points. This is a quick note, not an essay.
- Be honest about friction — that's the whole point. The Reflection Agent reads these to improve the process.
- If nothing went wrong, say so: "### Process friction\n- None this iteration."
- If you have no suggestion, say: "### Suggested improvement\n- None."

## [2025-07-15] [enricher-lt] [enrich-lt-batch-1-3]

### What went well
- The pipeline protocol was clear and easy to follow: pick stubs, enrich, validate, commit.
- Validation script caught issues early and gave clear feedback; all 3 batches passed on first attempt.
- The first 15 Lithuanian entries were common greetings/phrases, so definitions were straightforward.

### What was harder than expected
- Several early entries (labas, labanakt, sudie, etc.) had empty `partOfSpeech`; deciding between "phrase" and "adverb" for single-word expressions like "taip", "ne", "gerai" required judgment.
- "prašom" has multiple distinct uses (you're welcome / please go ahead) — collapsing into one meaning felt lossy but kept the batch moving.

### Process friction
- None significant this iteration. The staging file structure and validation script worked smoothly.

### Suggested improvement
- Consider adding a `partOfSpeech` value like "particle" or "interjection" to `VALID_PARTS_OF_SPEECH` — many Lithuanian A1 words (taip, ne, ačiū) are particles, not true adverbs.
## [2025-07-17] [seeder-en] [seed-en-30-stubs]

### What went well
- Protocol in VOCAB-AGENT.md was clear and easy to follow; stub schema and validation script worked on first try for all 3 batches.
- No duplicates against the 96 existing production terms — the dedup check was straightforward.

### What was harder than expected
- Minor mismatch between the task prompt's stub schema and the protocol's schema (e.g. `definition`/`example` at top level vs `meanings` array, `antonyms` vs `antonymTerms`). Resolved by following VOCAB-AGENT.md as the source of truth.

### Process friction
- None this iteration. Scripts, validation, and commit flow all worked smoothly.

### Suggested improvement
- Consider adding a `--dedup-against` flag to the validate command in the seeder instructions so production dedup is checked automatically during validation.
## [2025-07-17] [requirements-agent] [lt-vocab-app]

### What went well
- Goal description and notes in GOALS.md were detailed and specific — made writing acceptance criteria straightforward.
- ARCHITECTURE.md already documented the data model, JSON schema, and LT word structure, so requirements could reference concrete fields and files.

### What was harder than expected
- Deciding the right session size (10–15 items) required balancing the 5-minute constraint against spaced repetition needs — no prior data to calibrate against.

### Process friction
- None this iteration. Protocol was clear and all referenced docs existed.

### Suggested improvement
- None.
## [2025-07-17] [architecture-agent] [lt-vocab-app]

### What went well
- Requirements doc was thorough (21 ACs, edge cases, constraints) — made architecture decisions straightforward.
- ARCHITECTURE.md and existing source files gave clear picture of current state, so I could design precise model changes.
- Task dependency graph fell out naturally from the AC→task mapping; no orphaned ACs.

### What was harder than expected
- Deciding whether `word-meanings-model` (flat→meanings migration) should be a prerequisite for lt-vocab-app or independent. Resolved by keeping them separate since flat schema works for all 21 ACs.
- The SwiftData unique-key change (term→uniqueKey) has uncertain migration behavior — flagged as a risk but couldn't fully resolve without testing on device.

### Process friction
- ARCHITECTURE.md documents the `meanings` array as the production JSON schema, but `words.json` actually uses the old flat schema. This inconsistency required extra analysis to determine what the current truth is vs. what's aspirational.

### Suggested improvement
- Add a "Current vs. Target" section to ARCHITECTURE.md that explicitly marks which schema changes are aspirational vs. implemented, to reduce confusion for architecture/feature agents.

## [2025-07-21] [feat-tests-wordservice] [tests-wordservice]

### What went well
- The existing `WordService` API (`loadInitialWords(into:)`) was simple and testable — in-memory `ModelContainer` made isolated testing straightforward.
- Xcode project uses `PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup` (objectVersion 77), so adding the test file to the `VocabTests/` directory auto-includes it in the target.
- Both tests passed on first run with zero code changes to the production `WordService`.

### What was harder than expected
- No test target existed in the project; had to manually add a `VocabTests` native target, build configurations, dependency proxy, and shared scheme to the pbxproj file.
- `xcode-select` was pointing to CommandLineTools instead of Xcode.app; had to use `DEVELOPER_DIR` env var workaround.

### Process friction
- `docs/BUILD.md` says test targets can only be created via Xcode GUI ("cannot be done via CLI"), but manual pbxproj editing worked fine for objectVersion 77 projects. Consider updating BUILD.md to document the CLI approach.

### Suggested improvement
- Update `docs/BUILD.md` to note that for projects using file-system synchronized groups (objectVersion 77), test targets can be added by editing `project.pbxproj` directly without the Xcode GUI.
